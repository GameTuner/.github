## What GameTuner solves

Game Tuner is specialized for mobile game development. Below are some of the areas that GameTuner solves:
- It handles offline data and data latency. 
- Unique ID for multi-device users. This is something that GameTuner solves out of the box.
- Due to the unstable internet connection some devices don’t get ok response from server and try to send already sent data. It handles duplicated data sent from device.
- It calculates event loss percentage and report that to analytics users. Event loss is calculated based on event index tracked on user device.
- Does data modeling specific for gaming. 
- Provides direct access to both telemetry data and modeled data. 
- It contains a query engine that implements semantic layer between modeled data and end user with 150+ out of box metrics.
- A metadata service that holds and handles all meta information about registered games and system.
- It supports separate datasets for every registered application (games).
- It handles currency conversion for in-app purchases.
- Everything is built on top of GCP.

## GameTuner Components

GameTuner is built on top of Snowplow Open Source data pipeline. It contains next components:

- [GameTuner Terraform GCP][gametuner-terraform-gcp] - a set of terraform environments and modules to create and manage GCP resources for GameTuner project.
- [GameTuner Unity SDK][gametuner-unity-sdk] - a Unity SDK that collects events from mobile games and sends them to the pipeline.
- [GameTuner Collector][gametuner-collector] - a collector application that collects events from tracker and sends them to the pipeline.
- [GameTuner Enricher][gametuner-enricher] - an enricher application that enriches events with additional data and sends them to the pipeline.
- [GameTuner Loader][gametuner-loader] - a loader application that loads enriched events into BigQuery.
- [GameTuner Query Engine][gametuner-query-engine] - a query engine that implements semantic layer between modeled data and end user with 150+ out of box metrics.
- [GameTuner Metadata Service][gametuner-metadata-service] - a metadata service that holds and handle all meta information about registered games and system. One part of the service deals with schema maintenance.
- [GameTuner ETL Service][gametuner-etl-service] - an ETL service that does data modeling specific for gaming. Developed in AirFlow and deployed on GCP Composer. 
- [GameTuner Enrich Bad Sink][gametuner-enrich-bad-sink] - a service that is responsible for sinking pub/sub messages from enrich bad topic to BigQuery.
